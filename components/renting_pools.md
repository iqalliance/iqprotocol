Renting Pools
================================================================================

Many companies that could use IQ Protocol has already minted their tokens and had a ICO. IQ Protocol proposes a solution - declare ICO tokens as power tokens with infinite expiry date, and use Renting Pools.

The Renting Pool is like a lending pool, but with ability to rent power token at variable expiry dates.
It serves two purposes:
- ICO Participants can provide their ICO tokens to gain passive income.
- Consumers can rent power tokens at any expiry they wish.

In general, Renting Pools accept power tokens with any expiry length, and rent power tokens with short expiry dates.
From one side it allows to "supply" power tokens with a long expiry date, and from the other side it allows to "rent" power tokens with any expiry date that doesn't exceed supplies.
In this way, it effectively sort-of splits one power token with a long expiry date into several successive power tokens with a shorter expiry date.
With renting pools, the expiry dates listed by power enterprises become less of a problem, because practically one can rent power tokens with any expiry date from the renting pool, making power tokens somewhat-fungible across expiry dates.
Companies that didn't do ICO yet could continously mint, e.g. yearly power tokens, to match their supply capacity.

Power tokens are **refundable** by the owner before expiry.
Payment for power token is locked at first and gradually unlocked for power enterprises using geometric progression (except some fixed percent).
Remaining locked payment can be immediately refunded on burning the corresponding power tokens (as in cancelling the subscription).
