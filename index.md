IQ Protocol
================================================================================

IQ Protocol is created for the blockchain community:
- for [ICO Companies](users/companies.md) to easily adapt subscription based business model.
- for [ICO participants](users/ico_participants.md) to earn passive income on ICO tokens.

*If Tokens are like a decentralized money, then **Power Tokens** are like a decentralized subscription.*

[Power Token](components/index.md) is much more than a subscription:
- subscribe as easy as purchasing a token from a contract
- at any time refund, sell or delegate - in full or partially
- applicable to anything between news membership to weekly grocery deliveries
- enables unseen DAOs and smart contracts

<!-- To move elsewhere. -->
IQ Protocol proposes **Power Token** that is a generalization of subscription.
There are actually two types of Power Token - expirable (mandatory) and perpetual (optional).
Expirable Power Tokens uses ERC-1155 standard, where the token ID doubles as an expiration date.
Perpetual Power Tokens can be any token ERC standard, newly created or already existing like those sold in ICOs.
[Renting Pools](./components/renting_pools.md) are able to accept any and rent out Expirable Power Tokens.

ICO Companies
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*IQ Protocol empowers **product-as-a-service** business model*

ICO Companies can easily start to use Power Tokens on top of their already existing ICO tokens.

1. define the [utility](./components/power_tokens_and_energy.md) of Power Token.
2. declare that ICO token equal to a perpetual Power Token.
3. deploy [Power Enterprise](./components/power_tokens_and_energy.md#power-enterprise).

Done - no token migration required.
<!-- Deposit Company's ICO token reserves into the Renting Pool to start earning on your share of rents. -->
