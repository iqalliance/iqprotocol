IQ Protocol for post-ICO Companies
================================================================================

Companies that has undergone ICO are the prime potential beneficiaries from adopting IQ Protocol.
Let's walk through problems, benefits, costs and risks to assess how well that may apply to **your** company.




The Problems solved
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Companies that went into ICO had a token-based business model but for some it changed into one where tokens have no place.
It's normal to pivot or improve the business model, but with restrictions due ICO tokens lies the problem.
The said company have to either to ditch a better business model, or force tokens in the picture to it's detriment.
But with a better business model it should be a win-win for company and ICO participants, right?
Sadly not always due inflexiblity of ICO tokens.

IQ Protocol **upgrades** the ICO tokens into Power Tokens both **technically and business-wise**.
With flexibility of Power Tokens, they will fit the business model better.
Read on for details, or [usecases](./../usecases/index.md) on specific examples.
Think your business model is overly special?
Let's chat and [figure it out together](./../usecases/add_your_usecase.md).




Benefits
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To begin with, IQ Protocol's Power Tokens are ERC-1155 that already brings fungibility, batch transfers, etc.
On top of that, the IQ Protocol adds the following:
1. product-as-a-service approach, that can handle irregular consumption, refunds, discounts, etc.
2. franchising the product-as-a-service
3. new way to attract investment

TODO: more details.

<!-- Vanilla Power Tokens can even handle subscription to weekly grocery deliveries in vanilla, with lower fees than conventional tokens. -->




Costs
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Technically, there are two considerable costs.
First, to deploy [Power Enterprise](./../components/power_tokens_and_energy.md#power-enterprise) contract (XX to YY Gwei).
Second, to deploy [Renting Pool](./../components/renting_pools.md) contract (XX to YY Gwei).

Legally, it's required to declare a new utility for the ICO token and announce that.
The costs depends - anywhere from a simple blogpost to contractual struggles.
IQ Protocol makes it on the easy and flexible by an opt-in approach, not forcing ICO participants to convert ICO tokens.
That way IQ Protocol is non-exclusive and optional, that should ease the adoption legally as nothing is taken away.
IQ Protocol even may be used in parallel with another way to ICO tokens.

ICO tokens stay utility tokens and does not become securities because of IQ Protocol.
ICO tokens may be explicitly and voluntary exchanged for iTokens which are securities.

Business wise, it all depends.
See [usecases](./../usecases/index.md) for concrete examples.




Risks
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There is low cost slippage risks, as the activites above are fairly limited.

Downside is limited, because original ICO tokens are intact and thus IQ Protocol adoption is reversable.
It's as simple as cease to use it, divest ICO tokens from Rentint Pool at any time, and we're back where we started.

For early adopters there is a technical risk given inmaturity of IQ Protocol.
This is solveable over time, and usually fixable as we go.

As in any change, there are many unknown unknowns.
Think for yourself, use at your own risk, and do not take this as financial or legal advice.
