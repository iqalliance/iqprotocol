IQ Protocol for ICO Participants
================================================================================

ICO Participants can rent their ICO tokens at risk of not being able to immediately withdraw them.
In return they receive iTokens tho earn passive income on their share of rents.
ICO tokens are not securities whereas iTokens are, that ICO Participants can explicitly exchange between.

TODO: Details.
